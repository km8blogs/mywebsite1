<h3>About Us</h3>
<p>Artifacts was founded by a group of college graduates who wanted to find a unique way to celebrate and remember their college experiences. They noticed that there were few options available for alumni to display their college memories in a way that was both personalized and elegant. Artifacts was born out of the idea of creating high-quality custom art pieces that tell the stories of students' college experiences.</p>

<h3>How We Started</h3>
<p>The idea for Artifacts was first conceived when the founders were looking for a special graduation gift for a close friend. They wanted to give something that was both unique and meaningful, but they couldn't find anything that fit the bill. They decided to create a custom art piece that featured their friend's favorite places on campus, and the idea for Artifacts was born. The founders realized that there was a market for custom art pieces that captured the essence of college memories, and they decided to turn their idea into a business.</p>
